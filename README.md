# Hack4everyone

Best Practices in different diversity aspects so we have more accessible hackathons. The project started during [Hack the Hackathon Volume 3](https://hackthackathon.github.io/).

## Goal

Raise awareness of different groups of people, barriers to entry, and possible solutions for more accessible hackathons

## Getting Started

- You might need to target your hackathon to certain groups, but maybe not others ‚Äî> making it inclusive to everyone is very difficult!
- Bring in stakeholders from different communities you‚Äôre targeting! Make sure they are part of the organizing team
- It‚Äôs important to be aware that some of these categories are very context-dependent (e.g. understanding of ethnicity might depend on country; different nationalities have different visa restrictions in different countries)
- Many of these categories can possibly not be considered independently, but intersectionality needs to be considered
- Universal design: ‚Äúthe design of products, environments, programmes and services to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design‚Äù
- Universal design recognizes the common needs e.g. shared by persons with and without disabilities
- Being more inclusive needs more awareness on what diversity is, what are the different types of diversity
- To make more inclusive hackathons, consultations with diversity experts can be an option to upgrade the hackathons (eg workplace inclusion consultants)
- Hackathon organizers are often bound with a limited budget and with a high efficiency requirement, leaving opportunities for inclusiveness limited. Awareness raising needs to move to the design phase of the hackathon and the budgeting.
