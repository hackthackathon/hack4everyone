# Dietary Restrictions

## Barriers to entry

- with food provided at the event having dietary requirements means extra (mental) effort for participants if there are no clear accommodations
- moral/ethical/emotional vs. medical
    - first is already bad but second can be really dangerous
- categories for dietary requirements **(**[Healthline - most common](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/most-common-dietary-restrictions#10.-Food-allergies)):
    - religious diet
        - kosher
        - halal
    - allergies, intolerance
        - lactose intolerance
        - gluten intolerance
        - other allergies: wheat, nuts, fish, eggs, soy
    - value-based / other
        - vegetarian
        - vegan
        - keto
        - dairy free
        - low carb

## Best practices

- collect dietary preferences/restrictions pre-hackathon (and then also use that in planning the catering)
- “information policy”: labels on buffets, catering personnel is informed about food contents
- [MLH Guide](https://guide.mlh.io/general-information/event-logistics/hosting-hackers-with-dietary-restrictions): provide individual meals for people with food restrictions or give out vouchers/gift cards for them (→ for the latter also inform them about this beforehand so they can prepare accordingly)
    - special meals should also be kept individually so their not taken by someone else
