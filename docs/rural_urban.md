# Rural vs. Urban

## Best Practices

- Provide transportation - reimbursements for public transportation seem most cost effective
- Provide accommodation, preferably close to the hackathon location and easily accessible
- If basic school students, then coordinate a student chaperone for onsite hackathons
- Parental permits - most likely need to be gathered
- Participant reachout through teachers, civil society organisations working with youth

## General Considerations

- Rural areas often have limited or unreliable internet connectivity, which is essential for hackathon participants to research, collaborate, and access online resources.
- There might be a lack of computers, laptops, and other necessary hardware for participants, mentors, and organizers.
- Participants in rural areas may have limited exposure to technical skills, making it challenging to form teams and work on complex projects.
- Finding mentors with relevant technical expertise in rural areas can be difficult, depriving participants of essential guidance.
- Educational institutions in rural areas might lack resources and courses related to technology and entrepreneurship, leaving potential participants unprepared.
- Limited access to libraries, books, and online educational platforms can hinder participants' ability to research and learn new skills.
- Rural areas might lack suitable venues equipped with necessary facilities like power supply, seating arrangements, and presentation tools.
- Limited public transportation options can make it difficult for participants, mentors, and organizers to travel to the hackathon venue.
- Organizing hackathons requires financial resources for venue rental, prizes, catering, and other expenses, which might be scarce in rural areas.
- Securing sponsorships from local businesses can be challenging due to a smaller market and lower business density.
- There might be a lack of awareness about hackathons and their benefits, making it difficult to attract participants.
- Cultural norms in some rural areas might discourage the participation of women in technology-related events, leading to gender disparities.
- Rural areas often lack startup incubators, accelerators, and coworking spaces that can provide ongoing support to hackathon participants.
- Limited government initiatives and policies to promote entrepreneurship and technology education in rural areas can impede the growth of hackathons.
- Language barriers can exist, especially in ethnically diverse rural areas, making it challenging for organizers to communicate event details effectively.
- Limited internet access might result in fewer participants being aware of the hackathon, reducing overall participation.
