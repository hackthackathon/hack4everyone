How Trans-Inclusive are Hackathons?

*Recommendation 4: Provide Good Working Conditions for Participants. Some trans people might not feel capable of attending a hackathon due to their lack of technical knowledge or experience. Organizers could then create prehackathon events focused on inclusion and training, giving people a chance to feel more comfortable dealing with challenges. **The financial situation of the trans community, which is still a marginalized group, is also an issue. Organizers could offer proper equipment or propose.***

“We also discovered that opening up MIT required far more than declaring our event free for all to attend. We needed to recruit and actively welcome, not just invite. **This meant we had to provide travel funding, ensuring someone could attend instead of just inviting them to participate.**”

Prompt: “What measures can be taken in a hackathon to be more inclusive for people who do not have the means to participate?”

1. **Financial Assistance and Scholarships**: Offer scholarships or free entry for participants who cannot afford the registration fee. Additionally, provide travel stipends or accommodations for those who need financial assistance to attend.
2. **Remote Participation Options**: Facilitate remote participation through online platforms to eliminate the need for travel and accommodation, which can be a barrier for many.
3. **Tech Support**: Provide necessary hardware or software to participants who may not have access to the required technology. This could include lending laptops, providing software licenses, or ensuring high-speed internet access.
4. **Mentorship and Pre-Hackathon Workshops**: Organize workshops before the event to help less experienced participants get up to speed with necessary skills. Pairing them with mentors can also provide guidance and boost confidence.
5. **Diverse Judging Criteria**: Ensure that the judging criteria do not favor those with more resources or opportunities. For example, consider the innovation and effort relative to the participant's background and access to resources.
6. **Inclusive Environment**: Create a code of conduct that promotes a safe and welcoming environment for all participants. This should include anti-harassment policies and a diverse organizing team.
7. **Accessible Venues**: Choose event locations that are accessible by public transportation and are ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) compliant to accommodate participants with disabilities.
8. **Childcare Services**: Offer on-site childcare services for participants who are parents and may not have other childcare options.
9. **Diverse Representation**: Include diverse role models and speakers to inspire and encourage participation from all backgrounds.
10. **Flexible Scheduling**: Consider the various time commitments and responsibilities of participants by having flexible hackathon hours or multiple days of events.
11. **Language Support**: Provide materials and support in multiple languages if participants are not all native English speakers.
12. **Networking Opportunities**: Create opportunities for participants from less privileged backgrounds to network with industry professionals, which can be valuable for their future career prospects.
13. **Follow-up Support**: After the hackathon, offer continued support to the projects and ideas developed, especially those from underrepresented participants, to help them move forward.
14. **Feedback Loop**: Have a system in place to collect feedback from participants, especially those from underprivileged backgrounds, to continually improve the inclusivity of the event.
