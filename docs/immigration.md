# Immigration Status

## Best practices

- Consider the [language](language.md)
- Tapping into the mentor pool from the existing refugee community and the entrepreneurs - most relatable and achievable role models for vulnerable refugees
- Provide childcare or the opportunity and welcoming environment to come with a child (check [Family Status and Care Responsibilities](family.md) for more information)
- Develop a partnership with an organisation focused on refugee support and empowerment - to work with experts in the field and put their knowledge and wisdom into the activities
- Develop additional partnerships providing integration support services, entrepreneurship support services
- Have staff with both adequate language skills, cultural sensitivity, and business skills
- Besides training the staff, which is often quite costly, some organisations employ staff with a migrant background. Second-generation staff have the advantage of representing a bridge between the migrants and the receiving society â€“ as they both have a migration background and they grew up in the receiving society
- Another possibility is to use translators and/or linguistic mediators, which are often people with a migrant background (check [Language](language.md) for more information)
- The use of translators can be combined with the provision of printed and/or online materials in different languages, such as videos with subtitles and flyers
- To effectively support migrant entrepreneurs, the experience of existing support structures has underlined the importance of applying a comprehensive approach, which combines the different sets of support. The European Commission guidebook (2016) suggests providing at least three types of support at the same time - one kind of support for each of the three dimensions that we underlined in Section 1: support to improve business-related skills and competencies: business training, legal-administrative advice; mentoring and coaching; support to develop non-business-related skills and competences: networking and transversal skills; support to satisfy tangible needs: access to finance and provision of facilities.
- Focus on the portrayal and communication of success stories - that can raise awareness on the success and feasibility of refugee entrepreneurship, of female entrepreneurship
