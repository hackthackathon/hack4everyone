Best Practices:

Quiet rooms (suitable for both things like sensory overload and things like epilepsy) as well as sensory-friendly spaces

Having neurodiverse volunteers/mentors/organizers

Flexible participation options (such as virtual/chat only)

Straightforward agenda/schedule/to do tasks

Alternate modes to things like “project pitching” (this could be asynchronous like an app)

Facilitate team building (potentially create teams)

Reach out to/collaborate with societies/affinity groups/orgs

Code of conduct 

Keep main spaces organized and uncluttered*

If having prizes:

Diverse judging panel 

Wide variety of prize types/cost

*unclear how to actually do this especially with a chaotic event such as a hackathon.  What if the organizer also struggles with keeping things tidy?  What if many of the participants also do?  If we need more signage and other physically organizing objects how to have that compete with “nonclutter”.
