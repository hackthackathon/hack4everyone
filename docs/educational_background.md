*It is recommended that teams be assigned such that each team is as diverse as possible (e.g. in terms of skill level, academic background/working profession, the tertiary institution at which they study, nationality if applicable, gender, etc). Having diverse teams will usually allow for better peer learning and the development of soft skills such as teamwork, communication and collaboration.*

*A detailed application form should be created to ensure that all necessary information is captured for each applicant. This could include personal information, e.g. academic background/field or work (state the policy regarding the protection of personal information and ensure transparency regarding the use of this information), information regarding their existing knowledge/experience and, most importantly, their level of interest in data science and machine learning, motivation for attending such an event and what they hope to learn/gain*

Prompt: What measures can be taken in a hackathon to be more inclusive for people who have distinct educational backgrounds (different knowledge domains, college versus high school)?

Creating an inclusive hackathon that welcomes participants from various educational backgrounds, including those with different knowledge domains or varying levels of formal education, involves implementing strategies that level the playing field and encourage diverse contributions. Here are some measures that can be taken:

1. **Diverse Challenges**: Offer a range of problems to solve that require different types of knowledge and skills, not just coding. This can include design, business planning, community outreach, and more.
2. **Team Formation Assistance**: Help participants form balanced teams that include a mix of skills and educational backgrounds. This can be facilitated through team-building activities or a matchmaking system.
3. **Skill-Based Workshops**: Conduct pre-hackathon workshops on various topics to help participants learn new skills and understand the basics of different domains.
4. **Mentorship**: Provide mentors from various fields who can guide teams and offer insights into different aspects of project development.
5. **Resource Availability**: Ensure that all participants have access to the same resources, such as data sets, APIs, and tools, so that everyone starts from a similar point.
6. **Inclusive Communication**: Use clear, jargon-free language in all communications and presentations to ensure that all participants, regardless of their educational background, can understand.
7. **Judging Criteria**: Develop judging criteria that reward creativity, problem-solving, and impact, rather than just technical prowess or advanced domain knowledge.
8. **Peer Learning**: Encourage an environment of peer learning where participants can teach each other and share knowledge across different areas of expertise.
9. **Diverse Judging Panel**: Include judges from various educational and professional backgrounds to appreciate the different perspectives and skills brought to the projects.
10. **Recognition of Different Contributions**: Acknowledge and reward different types of contributions to a project, not just the technical aspects.
11. **Flexible Problem Statements**: Allow participants to define their own problems to solve, which can encourage them to draw on their unique backgrounds and experiences.
12. **Cultivate a Growth Mindset**: Foster an environment that values learning and growth over winning. This can help participants from all educational backgrounds feel valued and included.
13. **Post-Hackathon Opportunities**: Provide opportunities for further learning and development after the hackathon, such as internships, mentorship programs, or online courses
